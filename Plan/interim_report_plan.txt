Project plan

Abstract:
  •	Intro to project, key findings,goals and results

Intro &  Theory:
  •	Introduce Microboone experiment
  •	Microboone physics goals: 
      1.	Precision cross section
      2.	Low-energy electron neutrino events (excess of sterile neutrinos)
      3.	Resolving e- and gamma particle (photon) differences
  •	Microboone detector- LArPTc (liquid argon time projection chamber)
  •	Introduce Pandora, Pandora goals and algorithms, U,V,W & 3D views, MC simulations
  •	Cosmic ray muon background problems
  •	Interaction types and topologies e.g. CCDIS, CCRES, CCQE - also explain we are looking at final states in the MC heirarchy
  

Work Done:
  •	Goals of track vs shower identification from particle topologies and calorimetric info
  •	Further goals of particle identification
  •	Issues: 
      1.	Reconstruction error, gaps in detector- solution: look at purity & completeness values for reconstruction
      2.	Cosmic ray muon background – we have simulated data with and without this background, initially concentrated on data without background
  •	Technical issues: setting up a framework to analyse the data

    Variables:
      •	Sketch cartoons with motivation for each variable and explanations, including adversial examples
      •	Show distributions for variables, by purity/completeness cut and by particle type etc.
      •	Covariance between variables
      •	Show results of classification accuracy

Next term plans:
  •	Incorporate U,V views and 3D hit information
  •	Calometric info
  •	Deep learning
  •	Particle/event identification
