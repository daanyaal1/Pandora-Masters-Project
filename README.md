# Pandora Masters Project - Machine Learning in Particle Physics

Simulated data from the Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) detector at MicroBooNE is used to classify particles using both classical pattern-recognition approaches and a class of machine learning algorithms known as convolutional neural networks.

Note that most of the code in this repository is not well organised research code! If you are interested in this work, it might be easier to read the full dissertation write up: [Characterisation of Neutrino-induced Particles at MicroBooNE.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18219103/Characterisation.of.Neutrino-induced.Particles.at.MicroBooNE.pdf)
